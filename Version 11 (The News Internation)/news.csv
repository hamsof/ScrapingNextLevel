ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Senior Vice-President and former human rights minister Dr Shireen Mazari said Monday the intelligence agencies illegally tap phones and the Supreme Court (SC) should take a suo motu notice of tapping then PM Imran Khan's phone.
Referring to media reports, she said that another phone conversation on the secure line between Imran Khan and his principal secretary Azam Khan is also going to be leaked.
Mazari said what is in the audio tape is not the issue, insisting the real issue was phone tapping. She, along with PTI leader Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, told a hurriedly-called news conference here that an audio tape of the former first lady is circulating, which should be brought to light after a forensic test. She also asked how much assistance was given by the US in phone tapping.

Dr Mazari emphasised that the real issue is phone tapping. The government of former premier Benazir Bhutto was ousted in 1997 on the issue of phone tapping and the Supreme Court in its judgment held that phone tapping is illegal under Articles 8 and 14 of the Constitution. The court had said in its judgment that official or personal conversations cannot be recorded.
Citing an English daily, she pointed out that apart from this decision, there is a decision of Justice Saqib Nisar of 2015 in which one of the most interesting things was admission on part of country's prime intelligence agency that it recorded 6,856 phone calls in the month of May alone.
She said that intelligence agencies illegally tap phones because sensitive agencies have phone tapping technology. She remarked, “I ask why this series of illegal phone tapping continues despite Supreme Court orders as the secure line of Imran Khan's house was tapped. The Supreme Court should take a suo motu notice as to which agencies are there that are, despite court orders, taking illegal steps and violating the apex court order”.
Mazari contended that it has been reported that another audio is going to be leaked which is based on the conversation between Imran Khan and his principal secretary Azam Khan on the secure line. The former minister said if the audio is made public, it will not only violate the Supreme Court order, but also the Official Secret Act, and she will not remain silent on it.
The purpose of such acts, she claimed, was to hide the conspiracy and the nation has accepted the American conspiracy, so the neutrals and those who brought them are doing such acts so that the nation's attention is diverted from the issue.
Shireen Mazari said that after ‘our successful rallies, such conspirators, their handlers, neutrals and those they have brought, are nervous and trying to divert the attention of the people from this conspiracy and the country's complicated affairs in some way.
The IMF, she noted, was also asking this government to hold accountability against corruption while they (rulers) are not getting a place to flee. “I appeal to the defence institutions of Pakistan as to why they are pushing Pakistan to such difficult situations from where it becomes very difficult to return. The date of elections should be announced so that the nation elects its representatives and then form policies for the betterment of the country,” she contended.
She accused PMLN leader Maryam Nawaz of violating the Official Secret Act during her rallies every day, and wondered if this government and its handler are not violating the Constitution and law by showing official documents to a convicted person. “There are many similar questions that we want to ask neutrals and this government,” she said.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI Senior Vice President Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said that the loadshedding crisis in this country is getting serious and now it is being said that loadshedding will take place even during Eid holidays, while the government has admitted that all plants are on imported fuel and they do not have money to buy fuel.
Fawad said that the government has accepted all IMF demands to make petroleum products costlier, tax the public yet the IMF is not ready to pay, the IMF is saying it is hesitant to issue a package on changing anti-corruption laws.
The government, he claimed, immediately accepted the tax on the people but stuck to the issue of not enacting anti-corruption laws which gives an idea of the mindset of this government.
He alleged that the government changed the laws and gave itself a benefit of Rs1,100 billion as they gave themselves financial benefit under NRO, similarly Asif Zardari has been given NRO in the fake account case. “Therefore, Imran Khan says corruption makes your country poor and corruption worth billions of rupees of Sharif and Zardari family is hollowing out the roots of Pakistan,” he charged.
Fawad also said that phone tapping is a very important matter and phone tapping is being done in Pakistan and there is no monitoring, these calls are edited, not put to forensic test, human rights are being violated, allegations are being levelled against people.
He said that only yesterday, Farah Gujjar was accused by the PMLN of acquiring a plot in Faisalabad Industrial Zone at a price less than the market value, ‘while according to the documents we have, Ayaz Sadiq also acquired two plots at the same place, so Ayaz Sadiq also committed corruption’.
PTI leader noted that Farah Gujjar was reportedly being issued red warrants. He asked how warrants could be issued when no case was registered against her and the purpose of these false allegation campaign issued by the PMLN is only that they know that Imran Khan is the leader who has no lust for money.
Fawad said that ‘once again we repeat that we want good relations with the US, Europe, Russia and Western countries but that does not mean that a country can tell us who will rule our country as we cannot allow this thing. “It does not mean that no one even invited you to the ceremony and still you go there forcibly,” he said.
“After the accident that happened to Khawaja Asif at the age of 70-72, he suffers from psychological problems and often talks nonsense. If he has any evidence of contact with Donald Lu, he should make it public,” he said. He also talked on how 'rigging plan had been readied by PMLN leadership' for upcoming by-election.
Meanwhile, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb Monday said PTI leaders Fawad Chaudhry and Shireen Mazari confirmed that Bushra Bibi is the head of PTI's social media, generating a false narrative.
Referring to the news conference held earlier by these two PTI leaders, she said they confirmed Bushra Bibi was the ‘mastermind’ of the campaign of treason certificates and the drive against the institutions. “Fawad Chaudhry and Shireen Mazari have accepted that the audio is of Bushra Bibi and that ‘linking’ political opponents with treason, is her ‘opinion’.
The minister contented that the campaign against institutions was being run by Bushra Bibi, adding it was proved that an immoral press conference with dirty-language speaking spokespersons was being done at her behest.
“Bushra Bibi is running a social media campaign against national institutions, the narratives of treason, external conspiracy while hiding in Bani Gala. Bushra Bibi is in the forefront and behind the drive to link political opponents with treason and bad-mouthing. She is the mastermind of the campaign against institutions,” the minister charged.
Marriyum alleged that Bushra Bibi fabricated the narrative of external conspiracy and treason to hide her corruption. Bushra Bibi campaign against political opponents, journalists and institutions.
“PTI admits to making treason cases to hide its corruption. The champions of the false narrative of conspiracy abroad have been caught apologising and cajoling the US. Imran Sahib is delivering ""bygones are bygones"" apology to the US,” she concluded. "
"‘Gogi-Pinky Economic Corruption Corridor’: Nawaz made CPEC, Imran GPEC: Maryam",By Our Correspondent,"PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz addressing a publilc gathering in Lahore on July 4, 2022. Photo: Twitter
LAHORE: Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN) Vice President Maryam Nawaz said on Monday Nawaz Sharif had CPEC [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor], but former prime minister Imran Khan created GPEC — the “Gogi-Pinky Economic Corruption Corridor”.
Addressing a public meeting in connection with the PP-170 by-election campaign late Monday evening, she alleged that during the last four years, the poor people's tax money was deposited directly in the Bani Gala secret accounts.
Now, Maryam said, an audio clip of ‘Fitna’ Khan’s wife Pinki Peerni had come to the fore in which she was telling someone that if anyone asked about her (Pinki) and Farah Gogi’s corruption, he should link that to treachery.
Maryam said nothing was the bigger crime than misusing religion for achieving political motives, accusing and belittling opponents. She said ‘Fitna’ Khan misused religion to malign his opponents and incited his workers to attack them with hatred. She said ‘Fitna’ Khan was an imposter in the guise of a believer. His close aide was heard telling him during a speech at a public rally to give his address an Islamic touch.

She said the man who used to accuse his opponents as thieves and dacoits had proven to be the biggest criminal of country’s history. LNG, Farah Gogi, Pinki Peerni, atta, sugar, petrol and all big scandals came to light in the government of Imran Khan, which was unprecedented in the country’s history.
Maryam said Imran Khan had proved that he was the enemy of Punjab and Pakistan. She said a gang of thieves and dacoits ruled the Punjab, the province of 12 crore people, during the past four years and that gang kept masses deprived of basic needs during this period. Addressing Imran Khan, she challenged, “your politics is going to be wiped out from Punjab and all over Pakistan soon”.
She said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had to increase prices of petrol products with a heavy heart and he would reduce it as soon as prices of oil decrease in the world market. She claimed that Imran Khan government’s agreement with the IMF forced the present government to increase oil prices. If prices were not increased, the country would have gone bankrupt, she added.
Maryam said Imran Khan had been fooling people with false claims of a US conspiracy against his government. She said the ‘Fitna’ Khan used to say that Donald Lu had threatened him. But two days ago, he sent one of his ‘servants’ to Donald Lu, asking for forgiveness of the US administration over a mistake he had made by accusing Washington of conspiring to remove his government. She asked “can someone with sound mind make such a joke at the international level”, adding that he had made that serious joke with entire Pakistani nation.
She said all former friends of Imran Khan were revealing dark secrets of the ‘Fitna’ Khan every other day, adding that they include ‘her brother’ Aun Chaudhry, Jahangir Khan Tareen, Aleem Khan, who all claimed that they had never seen a person more corrupt than Imran Khan."
Amendments to NAB law: Imran files appeal in SC against registrar’s objections,By Our Correspondent,"ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Monday filed a chamber appeal in the Supreme Court of Pakistan against the objections raised by its Registrar Office to his petition challenging the amendments made to the NAB law.
Last month, Imran had challenged the amendments made to the NAB law, saying that they had the effect of legitimizing certain forms of corruption and creating select islands of unaccountability to exclude some people from the prosecution under the National Accountability Ordinance 1999.
He had prayed to the apex court to declare that the amendments made to the National Accountability (Amendment) Act (XI of) 2022 were ultra vires of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and violated the fundamental rights of the people of Pakistan as guaranteed by Article 9, 14, 19-A, 24 and 25 of the Constitution. He demanded that these amendments be struck off the statute book.
The PTI chairman had submitted that the impugned amendments to the NAO 1999 deprived the citizens of access to the law to effectively question their chosen representatives in case of breach of their duty towards people.
The SC Registrar Office had returned the petition by raising objections to it and questioned which rights of people had been affected due to the impugned amendments made to the NAO 1999. It had been further objected that the petitioner had not approached the right forum in this regard.
In his appeal on Monday, Imran contended that the objections were baseless and unjustified, adding that the Registrar Office had no jurisdiction to determine or decide about the maintainability of the petition.
He submitted that matters related to violation of the Constitution as well as fundamental rights of citizens were raised in the petition. He prayed that the apex court set aside the objections of its Registrar Office and fix the matter for hearing."
