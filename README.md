This is an ongoing version wise project supervised by Dr. Arif Butt (Asst. PUCIT) for scraping from Beautful Soup to Selenium, then working on Scrapy tool to making our own crawler. Will experience new chalanges of scraping and automation through this project.

Version 1 : Simple HTML page <br>
Version 2 : Html with CSS with table format of 9 books data. Have desgined python script for scraping from fetching data by looping over the contents of tables<br>
Version 3 : Completely New Layout in Grid and Flex model with Bootstrap for responsive design. The python scrypting is done by Beautiful Soup from fetching data by relevat Classes and ID`s <br>
Version 4: It is about the failure of Beautiful soup for scraping like adding js to pages: BS4 will not work also it cannot enter any keys or press enter any button.<br>
